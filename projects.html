                    <p>My Password Manager project was an ambitious project that I took upon myself with the idea
                        that sometimes, people have more than one potential password for a given account. Thus, I
                        created a CLI password manager with AES-128 encryption and SHA-256 authentication to learn a little
                        more about security measures. It utilizes a custom hash table implementation with secure file
                        storage and PIN protection. Here are some technical details:</p>

                            <li>Engineered a CLI password manager with AES-128 encryption and SHA-256 hashing for secure
                                authentication and credential storage, achieving zero plaintext exposure through 50+ simulated test
                                entries.</li>
                            <li>Applied modular, object-oriented design through 1,200+ lines of code to separate encryption,
                                authentication, and file management, supporting scalability and future feature integration.</li>

                    <p>A group project that I aided in designing and managing, the Unified Patient Manager is
                        a secure Electronic Health Records (EHR) system built with Spring Boot featuring
                        patient management, prescription tracking with conflict detection, and two-factor authentication.

                    <p>
                        PetTrackr was an individual project that derived inspiration from the Patient Manager. I wanted
                        to ensure I had all the understanding of what properly architectured systems were designed,
                        and ensured to keep myself within scope to finish this project over winter break of 2025/2026.
                        Formally, PetTrackr is a comprehensive full-stack pet management application that helps pet owners
                        track their pets' health, medications, feeding schedules, and veterinary appointments.
                        Built with Spring Boot and React to demonstrate modern web development practices with emphasis
                        on file handling and QR code generation. Here are more technical details:

                            <li>Developed RESTful API with 28 controller endpoints leveraging object-oriented design patterns and
                                database queries with JPA for efficient data retrieval across 5 interconnected domain entities.</li>
                            <li>Achieved 97% service layer test coverage through comprehensive JUnit and Mockito unit tests,
                                implementing validation logic for business rules and ensuring data integrity with cascade operations.</li>
